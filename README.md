## SBOM-Tester
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This a simple script that takes a [CycloneDX SBOM](https://cyclonedx.org/) in JSON format and analyses it against certain quality factors. Namely,
1. Correctness and presence of [PURLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec).
2. Correctness and presence of licenses per purl. Note: it correlates against [SPDX-license ids](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data).
3. Whether the SBOM entails the [dependency tree](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/#dependencies)
4. The presence of an [operating system](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/#components_items_type)
5. Whether the SBOM contains information on the tool that was used to create it


### Usage

1. Install required libraries
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: create a virtual env first
```bash

python -m env venv

source env/bin/activate

```

2. Run CLI and generate a report
you may pass a directory with many SBOM files or a single file.

```python
python main.py test/ --report 

```

4. Example report
```json
[
  {
    "filename": "test/cyclonedx-bom.json",
    "purls": 378,
    "percentage_valid_purl": 1.0,
    "licenses": {
      "valid_licenses": 372,
      "percentage_valid_license_id": 0.98
    },
    "is_schema_compliant": true,
    "operating_system": {
      "has_os": false,
      "os_found": null
    },
    "sbom_tool": {
      "has_tool": true,
      "tools": []
    },
    "has_dependency_tree": true,
    "quality_score": 0.895
  }
]

```

Note the `./test` folder contains CycloneDX SBOMs created for the [vsm-webshop project](https://github.com/leanix-public/vsm-webshop-demo) with the [CycloneDX python plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python), [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) and [ORT](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort). Feel free to play with those.

### Scoring 

You'll find that in `analyser.py` the function `grade_sbom` contains the weights for the above the factors:
```python
 weights = {
        "has_dependency_tree": 0.2,
        "valid_bom": 0.1,
        "has_operating_system": 0.1,
        "valid_licenses": 0.1,
        "valid_purls": 0.5

    }

```

and further down you'll also see the weighted scoring
```python
score = (score_dep_tree * weights['has_dependency_tree']) + (score_valid_bom * weights['valid_bom']) + (
        score_operating_systems * weights['has_operating_system']) + (score_licenses * weights['valid_licenses']) + (score_purls * weights['valid_purls'])
```

In simple words, the scoring looks at:
1. whether the SBOM has a [dependency tree](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/#dependencies)
2. the BOM file is of a [valid CycloneDX schema](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/)
3. Contains an [operating system](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/#components_items_type)
4. Has [SPDX-valid license ids](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data)
5. Has [purls](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) that conform with the spec.

#### Changing the weights
Feel free to change the `weights` array according to your needs. Ensure that all weights add up to 1 ;)
